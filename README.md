# FutureMinds

### This repository is for the new version of futureminds.in

<br>
It uses NodeJS TypeScript and SCSS in frontend, NodeJS as backend.

---

To get started clone the repository and run

```
npm install

cd ./client

npm install
```

I use prettier for formatting the code. To keep the consistency during the development, I would suggest you do the same. (It is in dev-dependencies).

There are some dev-dependencies in client, I would recommend you install them too. They include <strong>scss</strong>, <strong>typescript</strong> and <strong>@types/react</strong>

```
cd ./client && npm install --dev
```
