# FutureMinds

### This repository is for the new version of futureminds.in

<br>
It uses NextJS TypeScript as frontend, NodeJS as backend.

---

To get started clone the repository and run

```
npm install
```

I use prettier for formatting the code. To keep the consistency during the development, I strongly suggest you do the same. (It is a dev-dependency).

There are some other dev-dependencies i.e. <strong>scss</strong>, <strong>typescript</strong> and <strong>@types/react</strong>. To install them, run

```
npm install --dev
```
